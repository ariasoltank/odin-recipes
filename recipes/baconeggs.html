    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spray pan with cooking oil and allow it to heat up for a few minutes. Then, place bacon 
        on pan slowly and allow it to cook to crispy (about 6 minutes each side). After the bacon is 
        ready, take it off the pan and re-spray with oil. Crack two eggs onto the pan and allow them to cook
        for about 4 minutes until they are ready. Sprinkle salt and pepper on eggs to taste.
