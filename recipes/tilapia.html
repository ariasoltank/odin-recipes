    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Start off with tilapia fillets from Costco. Season the tilapia with salt and pepper on both sides 
        while heating up a frying pan with avocado oil. Once the oil is hot, slowly place the tilapia on 
        the pan until it reaches a golden orange color (~6 minutes). Then, flip the tilapia over and cook
        for another 6 minutes until golden and crispy on both sides. Enjoy with a side of veggies.
